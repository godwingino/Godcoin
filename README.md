# Godcoin

Godcoin is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency project that features a simple implementation of a blockchain, including wallet creation, transactions, and a proof-of-work mining mechanism. It allows users to create wallets, send and receive transactions, and mine coins. The application is built using Flask, providing a simple web interface to interact with the blockchain.

## Features

- **Blockchain**: Simple implementation of a blockchain with proof-of-work.
- **Wallets**: Generate new wallets with public/private keys.
- **Transactions**: Send and receive transactions on the blockchain.
- **Mining**: Mine blocks to earn Godcoins.
- **Web Interface**: A Flask-based web interface to interact with the blockchain, view wallet details, and more.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/godwingino/Godcoin.git
   cd Godcoin
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
To start the application, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You can open this URL in your browser to interact with the blockchain.

API Endpoints
/
Method: GET
Description: The home page of the application. Displays the list of wallets.
/wallet/<address>
Method: GET
Description: Displays details of a specific wallet (balance, etc.).
/wallet/new
Method: GET
Description: Generates a new wallet (public/private key pair).
/balance/<address>
Method: GET
Description: Retrieves the balance of a wallet.
/transaction/new
Method: POST
Description: Create a new transaction between sender and recipient.
/mine
Method: GET
Description: Mines a new block and rewards the miner with 50 Godcoins.
/chain
Method: GET
Description: Displays the entire blockchain.
How to Mine Godcoins
To mine Godcoins, navigate to the mine route and provide the miner's address as a query parameter. For example:

arduino
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:5000/mine?miner_address=<YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY>
This will create a new block in the blockchain and reward the miner with 50 Godcoins.

Wallets
Each wallet is represented by a public/private key pair. You can generate a new wallet via the /wallet/new endpoint, and use the public key to receive Godcoins. The private key should be kept secret, as it is used to sign transactions.
